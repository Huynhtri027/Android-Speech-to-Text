# Android-Speech-to-Text-with-BananaPi

This project explains how to build a small box to apply speech recognition for acoustically challenged people. The hardware I used to build this appliance was a BananaPi connected to a small touchscreen and a microphone.
This appliance listens to a converstaion and publishes every word on the touchscreen. The programm runs in a endless loop until the user pushes the button to stop listening. The app is scrolling down with the published text by itself.
In the bin folder of this repository is a .apk file, ready to install and use on any android device (smartphone, tablet, ...). 
The documentation in this repo is unfortunatelly in german.
Have fun!
